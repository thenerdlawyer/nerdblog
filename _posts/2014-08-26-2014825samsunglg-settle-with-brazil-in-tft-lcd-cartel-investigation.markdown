Samsung and LG have signed "cease and desist agreements" (TCC's) with CADE, Brazil's Administrative Council of Economic Defense, bringing to an end a six-year-long investigation into a global conspiracy to fix the prices of TFT-LCD displays by the Brazilian competition/antitrust regulator. Samsung agreed to pay BRL 8.9 million; LG agreed to pay BRL 33.8 million. The consent decrees, which are the latest in a long string of settlements, judgments, fines, and convictions related to the TFT-LCD cartel, are notable because they were reached under CADE's new regulations, which [require any agreement reached with the target of a cartel investigation to include an admission of guilt](/s/Settlement_Brazil_Dezembro.pdf)**.**
