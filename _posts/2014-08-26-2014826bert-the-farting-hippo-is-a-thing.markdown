Apparently, the show "NCIS" occasionally features a [fictional flatulent plush hippopotamus](http://www.ncisfanwiki.com/page/Bert+The+Hippo) named Bert. Bert is apparently a "soft sculptural puppet" produced by [Folkmanis, Inc.](http://www.folkmanis.com),[^1] under the decidedly less evocative name of "[Hippo](http://www.folkmanis.com/Prod-67-1-212-1/hippo.htm)". Apparently, CBS has been selling "Bert the Farting Hippo" [merchandise](http://www.cbsstore.com/bert-the-farting-hippo/index.php?v=cbs-ncis-bertthefartinghippo), including a Bert puppet,[^2] a Bert keychain, Bert slippers, and even a Bert _[costume](http://www.cbsstore.com/bert-the-farting-hippo-costume/detail.php?p=378798)_ in its online store.





Allegedly, in 2012, the puppets and keychains made by Folkmanis being sold on the CBS Store were replaced with "slavish copies" made by a Chinese manufacturer. Folkmanis has filed a [complaint](/s/1-main.pdf) in the Northern District of California against CBS, the company that operates the CBS Store, the company that allegedly sourced the Chinese knock-offs, and the company that manufactures the alleged knock-offs. The complaint alleges willful infringement by all four defendants of Folkmanis' copyright in the puppet and the keychain.





_The puppet is currently 56% off on the CBS Store ($19.99 down from $44.95), but the keychain is still full price ($14.95). Oddly, if you buy the two together you will pay $0.05 **more** than full price ($59.95). The slippers are also on sale._















[^1]: Apparently, "A Folkmanis puppet sets the standard of excellence against which all others are measured." 

[^2]: "Please be advised that the retail version of Bert may not sound identical to that shown on NCIS."
