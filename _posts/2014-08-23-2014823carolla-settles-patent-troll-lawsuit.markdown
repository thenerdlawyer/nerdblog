Last week, Adam Carolla's podcast partnership settled with Personal Audio, the NPE that had sued him for patent infringement. Last year, after Personal Audio targeted Carolla's very successful podcast, Carolla "circled the wagons" and [crowd-funded a defense](https://fundanything.com/patenttroll?locale=en), raising nearly $500,000. Several weeks ago, Personal Audio [announced](http://personalaudio.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Carolla-DIsmissal_7-29-2014.pdf) that it had offered to dismiss the lawsuitâ€”apparently, Personal Audio had been under the mistaken impression that podcasting was a highly lucrative enterprise (one has to wonder why it took so long for Personal Audio to actually examine the industry it [claims to have invented](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/1/prweb10313865.htm)). The terms of the settlement are confidential, and neither party is permitted to make any public statement about it until September 30, 2014.
