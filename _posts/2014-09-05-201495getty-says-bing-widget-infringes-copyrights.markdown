A few weeks ago, Microsoft launched a new service called "[Bing Image Widget]".[^1] The "Widget" is a string of code that you embed in your website, and which will stream images corresponding to any search terms you select to a configurable panel on the site. Here is the Widget for "nerd":

You can choose to display images in the Widget in "collage" form, as above, or in "slideshow" form. Here's "lawyer" in slideshow form:

[Microsoft's terms of service] restrict the user from doing any of the following:

> (h) use the Services to violate the law or for any unauthorized purpose;
> (i) use the Services to infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of anyone;
> (h) copy, store, or cache any Bing Image Widget or Bing results or image information from the Services;
> (j) commercialize (i.e., sell, rent, or lease) Bing Image Widget or Bing results; &gt; &gt;

Getty Images, Inc. has a similar service called "[Embed]". Embed draws search results from Getty's own collection of images, and generates code that will publish a single image on your website. Here's an Embedded Getty image showing one of the three results for "nerd lawyer".

[Getty's terms of service] restrict use of their embedded viewer as follows:

> You may only use embedded Getty Images Content for editorial purposes (meaning relating to events that are newsworthy or of public interest). Embedded Getty Images Content may not be used: (a) for any commercial purpose (for example, in advertising, promotions or merchandising) or to suggest endorsement or sponsorship; (b) in violation of any stated restriction; (c) in a defamatory, pornographic or otherwise unlawful manner; or (d) outside of the context of the Embedded Viewer.

Getty's [FAQ] tells a slightly different story:[^2]

> **Are there any restrictions for using a Getty Images photo I’ve embedded on a website, social media site or blog?**

Yes. You may not use Getty Images embedded photos for the following purposes or in the following manner:

• Commercial use intended to sell a product, raise money, or promote or endorse something.

• Any use that is defamatory, pornographic or otherwise illegal.

• Any use that violates a stated restriction on the gettyimages.com image details page.

• Any use outside of the context of the embed functionality. &gt; &gt;
Yesterday, Getty sued Bing for copyright infringement in the Southern District of New York, alleging that images published through Microsoft's Widget "typically consist of copyrighted images, including images whose copyrights are owned or controlled by" Getty. Getty alleges that the Widget has "been implemented by websites around the world – including in commercial settings…."

Getty alleges that the larger-sized images displayed in the "slideshow" view are "hosted and served from the third-party website that hosts the image and from which \[Microsoft\], through Bing Image Search, made its copy of the thumbnail version of the image." Getty further alleges that:

> Defendant intentionally masks the third-party source website and any context that surrounds the image as it appears on that third-party site, creating the appearance that the image is instead coming from the Bing-branded display panel. Further masking the image's origin (and serving Defendant's own commercial interests), clicking the image takes the user not to the third-party source website, but instead to Defendant's own Bing Image Search site.

Microsoft will no doubt rely on the Ninth Circuit's decision in *Perfect 10*.[^3] Below, I lay out my first impressions of how I think Getty might fare based on that decision.[^4]

Direct Infringement
===================

Based on the allegations in the complaint I would expect Getty to attempt to distinguish *Perfect 10* on the basis that the Widget displays larger images, not just thumbnails. However, Perfect 10 itself raised a similar defense in what appear to have been similar circumstances, and was unsuccessful.[^5] In *Yandex*, Perfect 10 argued that, unlike Google, Yandex's image search linked directly to a full-size version of the image stored on Perfect 10's website, but displayed that image on a webpage with the Yandex logo on it. The court declined to distinguish this from the "in-line" linking that the Ninth Circuit held was not infringing in *Pefect 10*.[^6]

Fair Use
--------

Microsoft also can be expected to raise a fair use defense.

**Purpose and character.** Although it relies on the Bing search engine to select the images it displays, the Widget would not seem to provide the same "informative function," or provide an "entirely new" use or context as a page of search results. The intended end use of the images would seem to be for aesthetic purposes,[^7] and Microsoft's use of the images appears to be primarily for a commercial purpose. In its terms of service, Microsoft reserves the right to include its own trademarks or logos, as well as advertising, in the images provided through the Widget, and restricts the user's right to monetize pages in which the Widget is embedded.

**Nature of work.** The images are likely to be found to be (at least mostly) creative in nature, but obviously also previously published on the Internet.

**Amount and substantiality.** It appears that the Widget displays the entire image. Like Google before it, Microsoft can argue that use of the entire image is necessary for the purposes of displaying search results. The purpose of the Widget is somewhat different, however, and I suppose an argument could be made that the usefulness of the Widget would not be impaired by using only parts of images.

**Effect of use.** The Widget is more closely aligned with the potential market for images on the Internet than are search results. Getty itself uses (and has been using) the images it alleges Microsoft is infringing in a very similar way.

Contributory Infringement
=========================

There is a strong argument that the end users are directly infringing Getty's copyrighted images[^8] when they publish those images on their websites, and the Widget almost certainly provides end users with "substantial assistance" in that regard. Getty makes a conclusory allegation that Microsoft can "stop or limit infringement occuring through the use of the Bing Image Widget." However, Microsoft's terms of service do not assert the right to limit or remove the images that appear in the Widget. Notably, the complaint does not allege that Getty notified Microsoft that it was infringing specific works. If Microsoft can and has taken steps to exclude Getty's images from the Widget, actual knowledge may present an insurmountable hurdle.

Vicarious Infringement
======================

As noted above, Microsoft's terms of service suggest Microsoft may not have the technical and/or practical ability to control end users' use of the Widget and the images therein. However, the fact that every website using the Widget has Microsoft's code embedded in it suggests at least a greater level of control/ability to monitor than in the case of images on Google's search results page.

On a first look, my sense is that Getty will have a very hard time proving direct infringement because Microsoft doesn't store the full-size images on its servers. If Getty can get over that hurdle, I think it has the better of the fair use argument. I think it is likely that the court will find that the purpose of the Widget is less transformative than that of a search engine. Whether Microsoft is secondarily liable will probably turn on the underlying technology; specifically, the extent to which Microsoft has the ability to monitor, control, and limit the use of the Widget and the images it displays. If Microsoft lacks the technical or practical ability to do that, it should be able to avoid secondary liability. On the other hand, if it *does* have that ability, the question will be whether, when, and to what extent Microsoft acted to ensure that Getty's copyrighted images were not being displayed on the Widget once Microsoft became aware of the alleged infringement.

[^1]: I had no idea either. 

[^2]: I see a blog post on [conflicting terms and policies] in my future. 

[^3]: *Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.*, 508 F.3d 1146 (2007). 

[^4]: District courts in the Second Circuit have repeatedly followed *Perfect 10*. 

[^5]: *Perfect 10, Inc. v. Yandex N.V.*, 962 F.Supp.2d 1146 (N.D. Cal. 2013) ("Yandex"). 

[^6]: The Ninth Circuit also rejected Perfect 10's arguments based on potential confusion about the source of the images in *Perfect 10*: "While in-line linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion." *Pefect 10*, 508 F.3d 1146 at 1161. 

[^7]: Although the actual purpose of use may vary from website to website. 

[^8]: Getty's images are licensed in a variety of different ways, so the case for direct infringement may be stronger for some images than for others.
