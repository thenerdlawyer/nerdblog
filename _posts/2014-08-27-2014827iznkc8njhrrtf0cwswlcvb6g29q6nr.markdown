In light of the growing number of companies seeking to trim costs by bringing more (and more significant) litigation in-house, I found the recent decision from the Southern District of California in _Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. v. Razer USA, Ltd._[^1] of particular interest. Mad Catz alleges that Razer is infringing a patent related to gaming mice; Razor is counterclaiming for alleged infringement of a patent related to backlighting of gaming keyboards. Mad Catz is represented by two in-house lawyers, including its General Counsel (Whitney Evan Peterson), who is lead trial attorney. Nevertheless, the protective order in the action precluded Peterson from accessing any documents or information produced by Razor or any third party (with one exception). Mad Catz moved to modify the protective order to give its lead counsel access to all documents and information; Razor opposed, arguing that Peterson (who also holds the title "Vice President of Business Affairs") should not have access to sensitive information that could provide Mad Catz with an unfair competitive advantage.

**The Legal Standard**

The Ninth Circuit applies a balancing test to determine the appropriateness of restricting attorney access to confidential information.[^2] The prejudice to the party whose attorney is being denied access is weighed against the risk of inadvertent disclosure by the attorney and the potential harm such disclosure could cause. The question is obviously highly fact-dependent, and must be addressed separately with respect to each attorney.[^3] Where the protective order at issue is a stipulated order (i.e., no party has made a showing of "good cause" in support of the order), the burden falls to the party seeking to maintain the protection against disclosure (here, Razer).

The risk of inadvertent disclosure turns largely on the extent to which the attorney is a "competitive decision maker"—in other words, does counsel advise on and/or participate in business decisions that would be made taking into account the kind of information about its competitor that is being protected from disclosure. Regular contact with decision makers is not enough—there must be "advice and participation" in "competitive decisionmaking."[^4] There is an unacceptable risk where disclosure "would place that attorney in the 'untenable position' of having to refuse his employer legal advice on … competitive \[\] decisions lest he improperly or indirectly reveal' another company's highly confidential information."[^5]

A showing that the protective order increases the difficulty of managing litigation is not by itself sufficient to establish "actual prejudice."[^6] Actual prejudice can be shown where the litigation is sufficiently complex and far along that retaining new counsel would "create an extreme and unnecessary hardship,"such as where the use of in-house counsel is necessary due to in-house counsel's specialized expertise, to maintain the financial stability of the party, or due to outside counsel's lack of competence.[^7]

**The Mad Catz Decision**

In assessing the potential harm to Razer, the court focused on the scope of Peterson's responsibilities, finding that: (1) as General Counsel, Peterson focuses on litigation and compliance rather than business decisions; (2) when negotiating licensing deals, Peterson focuses on legal issues and merely "parrots" the business terms communicated to him; and (3) Although Peterson does make competitive decisions in his role as VP of Business Affairs, those decisions are limited to Mad Catz' flight simulation business, in which Razer is not a competitor. The court also noted that Peterson did not regularly interact with individuals who would be involved in business decisions regarding competitive keyboard or mouse issues, and that his office and files are "private and secure."

On the other side of the scales, the court found that the existing protective order "effectively disqualifies Mad Catz' lead trial attorney," and that Peterson's role in the litigation was important enough to warrant modification. The court considered, *inter alia*, the fact that Mad Catz maintains "a two-person inhouse patent litigation team only," in part to keep legal costs down; that Peterson is always Mad Catz' lead trial counsel; and that Mad Catz has no outside counsel familiar with its patents and technology.[^8] The court also noted Peterson's "superior expertise" in the field of patent litigation.

Mad Catz' approach is unquestionably appealing, especially in patent or other litigation involving complex proprietary technology and information. Appropriately qualified in-house counsel can be expected to bring to bear greater familiarity with the company's technology and business affairs than outside counsel. In-house counsel also is likely to have better and easier access to company information and personnel, and—assuming litigation does not materially impact the attorney's other responsibilities—represent a substantial cost savings vs. outside counsel.

On the other hand, not all in-house attorneys have Peterson's "superior expertise" in litigation. Sending a corporate lawyer into court can be akin to bringing a knife to a gunfight. Patent litigation in particular requires familiarity not only with the technology at issue but with the procedural ins and outs of that singular form of litigation. And, *Mat Catz* notwithstanding, there is always the risk that in-house trial counsel will be hobbled by a protective order. Whatever cost savings may be realized by avoiding the use of outside counsel likely will be wiped out if outside counsel ultimately needs to be brought in (and get up to speed) at a later stage in the litigation. Likewise, the absence of outside attorneys' fees will be small comfort if the absence of litigation experience results in a less favorable judgment.
