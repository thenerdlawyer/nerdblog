Whether Customer Service is an internal department or outsourced to a third party, attention must be paid to ensuring that CS personnel are adequately trained and equipped to act in a manner consistent with the laws of each jurisdiction in which consumer issues may arise. For a company with significant global reach [^1], this can quickly become burdensome and expensive. Local laws must be researched (and often carefully analyzed and interpreted with the help of local counsel—some countries have not yet updated laws written with brick-and-mortar stores in mind, yet those laws apply equally to online sales); separate scripts must be written for specific countries, and specific situations within those countries; CS personnel must be trained to use those scripts and any associated escalation policies; and often additional personnel must be employed. But this increased cost must be balanced against the risk of regulatory action/consumer litigation and associated fines/damages awards, which can be quite substantial.

Refunds
-------

Many sellers of online video games have a "no refunds" policy. Such a policy makes sense given the nature of the product and the delivery system. Unscrupulous consumers could buy a game, play it through, then return it. Some platforms make it difficult to remove a game once it has been purchased, effectively meaning that a user obtaining a refund would be permitted to keep the game for free.[^2] Having a blanket "no refunds" policy also can save considerable expense associated with responding to and processing refund requests.

Most policies also include qualifying language to the effect that there are no refunds "except where required by law." This is because consumer protection laws vary, often substantially, from country to country. Many countries grant consumers guaranteed rescission windows, or statutory warranties. The Brazilian Consumer Protection Code ("CDC"), for example, entitles consumers who purchase goods or services "outside of a commercial establishment" (e.g., online or by telephone or fax) to rescind a transaction **for any reason** within seven days of signing the contract or receiving the goods or services.[^3] In the event that the consumer exercises this transaction, the amounts paid by consumers must be returned "immediately."[^4]

For companies doing business in multiple countries, the catch-all "except where required by law" is often preferable to attempting to craft separate terms for each country. However, the written policies are only the first (and often weakest) line of defense. If actual practice does not conform with policy (or local law), the terms of service will be of little help in the face of a regulatory action. Typically, consumer protection agencies do not proactively review terms of service looking for violations; rather, they act based on consumer complaints. And consumer complaints usually arise out of specific interactions with the company—often, with Customer Service.

Valve
-----

Take Valve, for example. Valve's [Steam Refund Policy] is stated as follows:

<blockquote>
> As with most software products, **unless required by local law**, we do not offer refunds or exchanges on games, DLC or in-game items purchased on our website or through the Steam Client. Please review Section 3 of the Steam Subscriber Agreement for more information.

</blockquote>
Interestingly, the Steam [Subscriber Agreement] itself does not contain such a broad exeption:

<blockquote>
> ALL CHARGES INCURRED ON STEAM, AND ALL PURCHASES MADE WITH THE STEAM WALLET, ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF THE PAYMENT METHOD, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

</blockquote>
The only exception in the Subscriber Agreement is directed specifically at subscribers in the EU.[^5] The Subscriber Agreement does not explicitly refer back to the Refund Policy.[^6] Thus, the potential exists for some consumers to have a different understanding of the refund policy than others, or for consumers to be confused about the refund policy.

Last week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) [announced] that it is taking action against Valve for violating Australian consumer law. Specifically, the ACCC alleges that:

<blockquote>
> Valve made false or misleading representations to Australian customers of Steam that:

> -   consumers were not entitled to a refund for any games sold by Valve via Steam in any circumstances;

> -   Valve had excluded, restricted or modified statutory guarantees and/or warranties that goods would be of acceptable quality;

> -   Valve was not under any obligation to repair, replace or provide a refund for a game where the consumer had not contacted and attempted to resolve the problem with the computer game developer; and

> -   the statutory consumer guarantees did not apply to games sold by Valve.

</blockquote>
Based on the language above, the ACCC is not basing its allegations on Valve's written Refund Policy or its Subscriber Agreement. Rather, it is most likely that the representations at issue were made to individual consumers by customer service representatives. Those representations are inconsistent with the Refund Policy, and almost certainly do not reflect Valve's *actual* policies with respect to Australian law. What probably happened is that customer service representatives were trained with respect to Valve's general "no refunds" policy but did not receive much or any specific direction with respect to local laws that could require departure from that policy.

Conclusion
----------

The bottom line is this: satisfied customers do not file complaints with regulators or file lawsuits. The clarity, prominence, and language[^7] of applicable terms and conditions is important, but consumer contact with customer service is where the rubber hits the road. How those policies are communicated and applied at the "street level"—during the consumer's interactions with CS—is of paramount importance in mitigating the risk of consumer complaints and regulatory action.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^1]: This is no longer the exclusive province of large, well-capitalized companies. 

[^2]: One possible workaround to this (assuming you can monitor application usage) is to get the consumer's agreement, in writing, that they must pay for the game (or you can cancel their account or ban them from the platform) if they use the game after receiving the refund. 

[^3]: The original intent of this requirement was to address the inability of a consumer to fully evaluate a product or service based on an oral or written description (as opposed to actually seeing the product or the service provider in a store or office). Providing a free "demo" version of an online game arguably would satisfy this requirement, and thus support an argument that the statute should not be applied to digital goods that can be evaluated in the exact context in which they would be used, but the statute provides for no such exception. The argument would have to be made to a (likely unreceptive) regulator after an investigation already has been commenced. 

[^4]: To complicate matters further, if the refund is made in a different calendar month than the purchase, the refund must be adjusted based on the Brazilian Consumer Price Index. 

[^5]: "IF YOU ARE AN EU SUBSCRIBER YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A PURCHASE TRANSACTION FOR DIGITAL CONTENT WITHOUT CHARGE AND WITHOUT GIVING ANY REASON UNTIL DELIVERY OF SUCH CONTENT HAS STARTED OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED. YOU DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM A TRANSACTION OR OBTAIN A REFUND ONCE DELIVERY OF THE CONTENT HAS STARTED OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED, AT WHICH POINT YOUR TRANSACTION IS FINAL. YOU AGREE THAT DELIVERY OF DIGITAL CONTENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED SUBSCRIPTION, AND/OR PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSOCIATED SERVICE, COMMENCES AT THE MOMENT THE DIGITAL CONTENT IS ADDED TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR INVENTORY OR OTHERWISE MADE ACCESSIBLE TO YOU FOR DOWNLOAD OR USE. " 

[^6]: The subscription agreement does state that "additional terms (for example, payment and billing procedures) may be posted on <http://www.steampowered.com>." However, that URL takes you to Steam's front page, from which you would have to go digging to find the Refund Policy. 

[^7]: In both senses of the word. Consumers should be able to access both written policies and telephonic/online customer service in their own language. This is both sound business practice and, in many countries, a legal requirement.
