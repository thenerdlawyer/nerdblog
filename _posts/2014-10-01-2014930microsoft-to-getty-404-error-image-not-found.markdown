A few weeks ago, I [posted](https://mbsmithlaw.squarespace.com/nerdlawyer/2014/9/5/getty-says-bing-widget-infringes-copyrights) about a lawsuit Getty filed against Microsoft claiming that the Bing "Widget" infringed on Getty's copyrights. Getty has asked the court to enjoin Microsoft from using the Widget, and Microsoft has opposed, asking the court not to make a "snap decision" without all of the facts about how the Widget works. Nevertheless, as of September 17, Microsoft has disabled the Widget.





Getty argues (as it must to get around the holding in _Perfect 10_) that the Widget does not function as a search engine, but rather as a "direct substitute for the licensed uses of" Getty's content. It also argues that the Widget does not constitute "fair use," more or less for the reasons I identified in my [earlier post](https://mbsmithlaw.squarespace.com/nerdlawyer/2014/9/5/getty-says-bing-widget-infringes-copyrights).





Microsoft asserts that the Widget does not make copies or display them, but rather points to third party websites that store and display the images. Microsoft argues non-infringement and fair use, because _Perfect 10_.





Getty urges the court to ignore the fact that the Widget only points to third-party source websites, which actually display the image, dismissing that fact as an "under-the-hood quirk of computer engineering." Getty relies on the recent Supreme Court decision in _Aero_, in which the court held that a technological difference "invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike" could not by itself render an infringing practice non-infringing. However, as Microsoft points out, in _Aero_ the court was addressing the question of public vs. private _performance_, not the copying or displaying of images, and expressly limited its holding to the specific technology at issue in that case.





The hearing on Getty's motion has been continued to October 3, while the parties engage in mediation.
