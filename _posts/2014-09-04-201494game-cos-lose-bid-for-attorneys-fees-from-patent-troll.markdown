Back in April, a group of game companies (Zynga, EA, Crowdstar, and Funzio) won dismissal of patent claims brought against them by GameTek LLC[^1]. As the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California noted in its order granting the defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings, it was "the rare case in which the defendants have met their burden at the pleadings stage to show by clear and convincing evidence that the … patent claims an unpatentable abstract idea." The defendants subsequently filed a motion for attorneys' fees pursuant to 35 U.S.C section 285, arguing that GameTek's action was an "exceptional case" justifying a fee award under the more relaxed standards recently articulated by the Supreme Court in *[Octane Fitness]*.[^2]

*Octane* holds that fee-shifting is appropriate where (1) the plaintiff engages in unreasonable conduct that is "exceptional," but not necessarilly independently sanctionable; (2) the case presents subjective bad faith; **or** (3) the case presents "exceptionally meritless claims." The Court construed "exceptional" in accordance with its "ordinary meaning" (which includes "rare") and concluded that an "exceptional" case is "one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position…."

Not surprisingly, the defendants argued that the acknowledged "rarity" of an invalidity determination at the pleading stage rendered GameTek's case, by definition, "exceptional."[^3] The district court disagreed, however, asserting that *Ultramercial* refers to the unlikelihood that the factual record would be sufficiently developed at the pleading stage to support such a finding and "is not necessarily a judgment on the relative stregth or weakness of the patentee's litigation position." The court further noted that "the substantive law in this area was unsettled" at the time defendants' motion was granted because the Supreme Court had not yet issued a decision in *Alice*.[^4]

The defendants also pointed to the district court's observations that GameTek provided "no meaningful atlernative," "no substantive counter-argument," and "no explanation" of what the patent at issue added to the abstract idea of mid-gaming purchasing. The district court acknowledged the weakness of GameTek's claims but held that it did not "descend to the level of frivolous argument or objective unreasonableness."[^5]

Finally, the defendants argued that GameTek engaged in unreasonable misconduct by taking unsubstantiated actions to increase the cost and burden of defending the action, including (1) violating the joinder statute when filing the initial complaint; (2) improperly suing defendants in the Southern District of California; (3) making unreasonable discovery demands and making repeated threats of motion practice; and (4) insisting on moving forward with depositions despite having recently added a new accused product to the case.

The district court found that, at best, defendants' allegations "may suggest an aggressive litigation strategy." It noted that GameTek was never found to have violated the joinder statute; that defendants ultimately conceded that venue was proper; that defendants had overstated GameTek's discovery-related conduct; and that defendants were not prejudiced by GameTek's deposition notices since the court granted their motion for judgment on the pleadings that same day.

To date, approximately half of all post-*Octane* motions for attorney's fees under section 285 have been granted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^1]: A non-practicing subsidiary of notorious non-practicing entity Acacia Research Group LLC ("[Setting patents free]"). 

[^2]: The prior standard, articulated by the Federal Circuit in *Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutalier Int'l, Inc.*, 393 F.3d 1378 (2005), required the movant to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, either (1) litigation-related misconduct "of an independently sanctionable magnitude" or (2) that the litigation was **both** "brought in subjective bad faith" **and** "objectively baseless". 

[^3]: In acknowledging that its order granting defendants' motion on the pleadings was "rare," the district court cited the Federal Circuit's decision in *Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC* that "it will be **rare** that a patent infringement suit can be dismissed at the pleading stage for lack of patentable subject matter." 722 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

[^4]: *Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l*, 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2360 (2014) (holding that requiring "generic computer implementation" does not transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention). *Alice* is expected to make it significantly harder to patent software-related ideas, and to result in the invalidity of a number of existing software patents. 

[^5]: The phrase "objective unreasonableness" comes from footnote 6 of the *Octane* decision, in which the Supreme Court recalls its holding that, under a similar fee-shifting provision of the Copyright Act, "objective unreasonableness" is one of the factors district courts should consider.
