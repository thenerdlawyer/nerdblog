Last week, the United States Copyright Office released a public draft of the [Third Edition of the Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices]. Although over 1200 pages long, it moves along surprisingly quickly—you'd swear it was only eight or nine hundred pages. Among other things, the Compendium attempts to clarify what is and is not a copyrightable work. For your convenient reference:

-   The "fruits of intellectual labor" are copyrightable; [fruits] are not.

-   A blank form is copyrightable; the empty fields or lined spaces in a blank form are not.[^1]

-   A work authored by "divine or supernatural beings" is not copyrightable; a work "inspired by a divine spirit" is—as is [a work about Divine].

-   A rock is not copyrightable; nor is a mere compilation of rocks;[^2] but a "[work comprised of rocks]" may be.

-   A [mural] painted *by* an elephant is not copyrightable, but a [painting] *on* an elephant is.

-   A photograph of a monkey is copyrightable, unless that [photograph] was taken by the monkey itself.

-   A story about an android dreaming of electric sheep is copyrightable; a movie based on a story about an android dreaming of electric sheep is copyrightable; an android's account of its dream about electric sheep is not copyrightable.

[^1]: I would love to see the application that prompted that particular clarification. 

[^2]: "Compilation of Rocks" is my "Flock of Seagulls" cover band.
