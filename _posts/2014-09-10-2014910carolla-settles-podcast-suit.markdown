[Didn't we just do this](http://mbsmithlaw.com/nerdlawyer/2014/8/23/carolla-settles-patent-troll-lawsuit)? 





According to the [Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/adam-carolla-settles-lawsuit-popular-731537), Adam Carolla has settled the lawsuit brought against him by his former partner, Donny Misraje. Apparently, the settlement was reached just before Misraje's expert was going to take the stand to talk about Carolla's profits.
