Several weeks ago, in what may be the first appellate decision to contain the phrase *"Spoiler Alert"*, the Seventh Circuit affirmed an order granting Warner Bros.' motion to dismiss trademark infringement claims asserted by [Fortres Grand], which offers for sale a computer security software program known as "Clean Slate®". Fortres alleged that the use of the phrase "clean slate" in Warner Bros.' *The Dark Knight Rises* to describe [an ersatz software tool] for erasing one's identity from every database on earth created customer confusion and resulted in a precipitous decline in sales following the movie's release. 
Over the course of the litigation, Fortres variously argued forward confusion, reverse confusion, and a sort of "reverse dilution". First, Fortres argued that consumers would be confused into thinking that the movie was "sponsored by" Fortres.[^1] Then Fortres argued that consumers would be confused into thinking that Fortres's software "emanates from, is connected to, or is sponsored by" Warner Bros. Finally, Fortres argued that consumers would be confused into thinking that Fortres' software *was* the fictional product created by a fictional company (Rykin Data), obtained by a fictional billionaire, and given to a fictional cat burglar (who dresses like a cat) by a man dressed as a bat (who is the fictional alter ego of the fictional billionaire) in exchange for helping the fictional guy dressed like a bat save a fictional city from a fictional terrorist who became absurdly strong due to fictional experiments conducted on him with a fictional drug.

On appeal, the Seventh Circuit addressed the question of whether it is appropriate, in applying the reverse confusion test, to compare a plaintiff's *actual* product with a *fictional* product that appears within the defendant's product, which is itself a work of fiction. The court noted that in cases where forward confusion has been alleged, courts have compared the plaintiff's tangible product to the defendant's own tangible product (a movie), rather than a product that appears in the movie. But, at least on appeal, that was not Fortres's claim.

Fortres argued *reverse* confusion, and the Seventh Circuit observed that "\[i\]n reverse confusion based on a junior user's movie … it is not so cut-and-dried. Because the confusion is about the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the *senior user's* product, which is tangible, there is no clear command that we compare that product (the software) to Warner Bros.' tangible product (its movie) when considering the \["similarity of products"\] factor."[^2]

15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1) provides a civil cause of action to:

<blockquote>
> \[a\]ny person who, **on or in connection with any goods** or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading representation of fact, which … is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or **as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods**, services, or commercial activities by another person….

</blockquote>
The Supreme Court has held that the the "origin, sponsorship, or approval of" the junior user's "goods" refers to "the "tangible product sold in the marketplace."[^3] The Seventh Circuit reasoned that "goods" in the first clause, referring to the *senior* user's goods, must mean the same thing and concluded that "WarnerBros.' movie—its tangible good—is the correct comparator product, even while using the product-similarity factor to analyze reverse confusion."[^4]

The obvious dissimilarity between a "utilitarian" software program and a blockbuster film notwithstanding, the Seventh Circuit focused on "whether the products are the kind the public attributes to a single source."[^5] The Seventh Circuit looked back on its decision in *McGraw-Edison*, in which it held that "'utilitarian electrical products' \[fuses\] could be confused as originating from the same source as 'entertainment-based' products powered by electricity \[videogames, toys, and telephones\] when both are labeled 'TRON,'" but distinguished that case on the basis that ""Warner Bros. does not sell any movie merchandise similar to Fortres Grand's software which also bears the allegedly infringing mark."[^6]

I'm not sure I agree with the court that the licensed merchandise would need to be "*similar*" to the senior user's product. First, fuses and telephones are not intuitively "similar" products. Second, given the broad range of licensed products and services that often accompany and follow the release of a movie (especially a blockbuster comic book movie),[^7] it certainly seems plausible that a consumer could be confused about whether or not the senior user's product is licensed by the junior user, regardless of whether the junior user has licensed a similar product. The court observes that Fortres Grand does not allege that "desktop management software is a commonly merchandised movie tie-in," but certainly it is no less likely to be merchandised than fuses or printer paper. The ever-increasing scope of movie tie-ins makes it more difficult to imagine goods that consumers would *not* expect to be produced in association with a film.

More to the point, the court noted that in this case Warner Bros. had not sold or licensed *any* products bearing the CLEAN SLATE mark, and therefore there were no goods to compare with Fortres's software.

Finally, Fortres argued that "internet chatter" about the plausibility of a tool like the one that appears in the movie demonstrates actual confusion. As the court noted, however, this would be, at best, evidence that some internet users may be confused about how stuff works; not that consumers might think that Fortres' software *was* the hacking software used by Selina Kyle in the movie. The court concluded that:

<blockquote>
> Fortres Grand's real complaint is that Warner Bros.' use of the words "clean slate" has tarnished Fortres Grand's "clean slate" mark by associating it with illicit software. But this type of harm may only be remedied with a dilution claim … and it would not be appropriate to use a contorted and broadened combination of the "reverse confusion" and "related products" doctrines to extend dilution protection to non-famous marks which are explicitly excluded from such protection by statute.

</blockquote>
And so we are left to wonder why a "significant decline" in sales of Fortres' "Clean Slate" software coincided with the release of *The Dark Night Rises*.[^8]
