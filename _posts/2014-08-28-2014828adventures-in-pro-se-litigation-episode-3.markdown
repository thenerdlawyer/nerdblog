Hassan Crawford is a *pro se* plaintiff suing debt collectors in the District of Maryland. Upon receiving defendants' first set of interrogatories, Mr. Crawford sent [a handwritten letter] to District Judge Ellen L. Hollander:

> *Hi Ellen greetings,*

> *i, a man \[hassan crawford\], who is the man or woman that is ordering me? I[^1] will be glad to do what you order and i'm going to charge a hundred dollars an hour.*

> *non assumpsit[^2] hassan crawford*

Mr. Crawford also sent [a handwritten letter][1] to defendants' counsel, requesting that they "leave \[him\] alone." When defendants' counsel attempted to meet and confer with Mr. Crawford, Mr. Crawford [invited counsel to join Twitter].

No doubt confused by Mr. Crawford's mixed signals, defendants sought the assistance of the court. Magistrate Judge Beth P. Gesner ordered Mr. Crawford to serve "complete and non-evasive responses" to defendants' discovery requests. Mr. Crawford responded with a [handwritten letter] to Judge Gesner:

> *Hi Beth greetings,*

> _i, a man hassan crawford, i am an i, not a you, who is the man or woman making this claim, i require compensation for having to respond to a false claim and for the time lost dealing with their false claim. i wish for a 'Dollar' for every second[^3] of naked possession of property. All you require is in my paperwork your honour.[^4] \[cf. Trinsey v. Pagliaro D.C. Pa 1964 229 F.Supp. 647\]_[^5]

> *non assumpsit hassan crawford*

Mr. Crawford then proceeded to send defendants' counsel weekly [invoices] in the amount of \$16,8006 each for time spent "fulfilling your order." One also included an "overdue late fee" of \$15,300.

Having still not received responses to their discovery requests, defendants' counsel filed a motion for sanctions. Beth has recommended that Ellen dismiss the case and award defendants their attorneys' fees. No word yet on whether Mr. Crawford will bring a separate action to recover his own hourly fees.

[^1]: This is, as far as I can tell, the only time Mr. Crawford capitalizes the pronoun "I". I will lose sleep pondering the significance of that fact. 

[^2]: I had to look it up. What? As the reunion committee just reminded me, it's been 15 years since law school. 

[^3]: Unclear whether this is in lieu of, or in addition to, the \$100/hour he quoted Judge Hollander. 

[^4]: More mixed signals. He starts with "Hi Beth", but by the end it's just "your honour." How fleeting, love. 

[^5]: Holding: the fact that a state in personam action attacking acts of a trustee might be revived did not preclude federal court from taking jurisdiction of an in rem action, nor was court precluded from taking jurisdiction by virtue of pending arbitration proceedings which would not determine title to the land involved. 

[^6]: \$100/hour x 24 hours x 7 days
