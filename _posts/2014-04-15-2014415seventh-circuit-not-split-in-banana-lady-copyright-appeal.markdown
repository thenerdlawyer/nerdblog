Recently, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of a claim for copyright infringement asserted by Catherine Conrad, an entertainer and motivational speaker. Ms. Conrad sought to hold the credit union that hired her liable for copyright infringement based on the posting of pictures and video of her performance on the Internet. *Conrad v. AM Community Credit Union, et al.*, Case No. 13-2899 (7th Cir. April 14, 2014).

In her professional capacity, Ms. Conrad assumes the *nom de guerre* "[Banana Lady]." The defendant had hired Conrad to perform a "singing telegram" at a trade event.[^1] Conrad alleged that she told the arrangers that audience members could not take photos or videos except for their "personal use." She further alleged that the arrangers failed to inform the audience members of this limitation until the performance had ended. Some members of the audience subsequently posted pictures and videos on "internet websites." Because the appeal was from a ruling on a motion to dismiss, Judge Posner—writing for a three-judge panel—assumed these facts to be true. He also assumed that Conrad had valid copyrights on her banana costume, as well as photographs and sculptures of the same.[^2]

Although Ms. Conrad's theory of infringement is not made clear in the opinion (and likely was not made clear at all), Posner held that:

-   the performance itself was not copyrighted or copyrightable (absent a recording or "dance notation");

-   the photos and videos made by audience members were not derivative works; and

-   the arrangers likely would not be liable for inducement (a theory Conrad herself did not put forward), because Conrad did not contend that any photos or videos were posted before the arrangers advised the audience of the prohibition against non-"personal" use.

Posner also:

-   found Conrad's contention that posting a photo to one's Facebook page is not "personal" use "implausibl\[e\]";

-   expressed surprise that "Adult Banana Costumes" are a "common consumer product;" and

-   invited the public to watch Conrad dance the "[Banana Shake]" on YouTube.

A copy of the decision, which includes a photograph of Ms. Conrad *in flagrante banana*, can be found on the 7th Circuit's [website].

[^1]: In its opinion, the Court helpfully explains, quoting [wiseGeek], that "\[s\]inging telegrams are a hilarious way to send a message that is a lot more fun than sending a fax, email, instant message or greeting card."
