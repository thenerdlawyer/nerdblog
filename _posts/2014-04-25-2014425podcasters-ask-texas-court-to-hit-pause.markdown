A group of podcasters being sued for patent infringement by [Personal Audio, LLC] in the Eastern District of Texas have moved to stay litigation pending the outcome of an *inter partes* review initiated by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation].

Personal Audio, a [non-practicing entity], modestly [contends] that it "invented … podcasting back in 1996."[^1] Personal Audio is asserting claims 31-35 of [United States Patent No. 8,112,504 B2], which relates to "a system for dynamically and interactively selecting and playing particular programs from a program library." The claims at issue broadly describe the serial distribution of episodic content over the Internet. Since January 2013, Personal Audio has sued at least eight of the largest producers and distributors of podcasts, including [Adam Carolla]'s ACE Broadcasting, and reportedly has demanded licenses from many others.

In October 2013, EFF filed a [petition] with the [Patent Trial and Appeal Board] requesting *inter partes* review[^2] of claims 31-35 of the '504 patent, asserting that the claimed invention is unpatentable because:

-   the distribution of episodic media content on the Internet was disclosed at least as early as 1993 (three years prior to the effective filing date of the '504 patent) by Carl Malamud's "[Geek of the Week]" series, the [SurfPunk Technical Journal], and a [1996 article] about the "CBC Radio on the Internet" experiment; and

-   the claims are obvious in light of "Geek of the Week" and a [1995 article] about the Internet CNN Newsroom.

Personal Audio filed its [response] on February 7, 2014, arguing that the petition should be denied because:

-   the EFF failed to cite any prior patents, relying exclusively on evidence of "public use or knowledge";[^3] and

-   none of the alleged prior art anticipates the use of a "compilation file" accessible via URL that is updated as new episodes become available.

On April 18, 2014, the PTAB [decided] to institute *inter partes* review. The PTAB adopted EFF's construction of three claim terms, which constructions were generally broader than those proposed by the defendants in the E.D. Tex litigation. The PTAB agreed with Personal Audio that the two websites cited by EFF were not "printed publications," but found a reasonable likelihood that the 1996 article anticipated claims 31-35 (including the "compilation file" requirement) and that those claims (including the "compilation file" requirement) are obvious over the 1995 article.

The defendants promptly filed a [motion] to stay the patent infringement actions pending resolution of the *inter partes* review. The defendants argue that the *inter partes* review will "likely narrow, if not completely eliminate, the issues pending before the Court," particularly since the Defendants have agreed to be bound by the PTAB's determination of validity. They also argue that, as a non-practicing entity, Personal Audio would not be prejudiced by waiting for the PTAB to issue its ruling.

The defendants have good reason to seek a stay. To date, few challenged claims have survived *inter partes* review. The consolidated trial in the Personal Audio actions currently is scheduled to begin in September 2014; the PTAB could take a year or more to issue its decision. If the trial goes forward as scheduled, the defendants likely will have to take their chances with a jury in Marshall, TX.[^4] On the other hand, if defendants succeed in putting off the trial until the PTAB issues its ruling, there is a decent chance that many—if not all—of the claims on which Personal Audio is relying will have been invalidated.

The odds that the court will grant the stay motion are not as good. Although the motion was filed just days after *inter partes* review was granted, that was also the day of the *Markman* hearing. The court may decide that the case is too far along to justify a stay. Further, although motions to stay litigation pending *inter partes* review are frequently granted, that generalization does not hold true in the Eastern District of Texas, a venue notoriously unfriendly to defendants in patent infringement lawsuits.

Stay tuned for further developments at this site, which will be accessible via URL and updated as new episodes become available.

[^1]: Personal Audio also claims to have invented the concept of "playlists," a claim that [got some traction] down in Marshall, TX. 

[^2]: *Inter partes* review is a relatively new trial proceeding (it first became available in September 2012 and the first decision was issued in November 2013) conducted by the PTAB to review the patentability of one or more claims in a patent only on the basis of anticipation or obviousness, and only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications. 

[^3]: Specifically, Personal Audio argued that websites are not "printed publications" under the statute because they were not reasonably accessible to anyone who did not have the specific URLs. 

[^4]:  Marshall is not known for its defendant-friendly jurors.
