It’s probably not what you think. The takedown notice in question was issued *by* the developer.

YouTuber[^1] Jim Sterling posted a critical review of Digipex Games’ *Skate Man Intense Rescue* based on their Steam Green Light trailer. Digipex clearly didn’t like what Sterling had to say, and they sent YouTube a DMCA takedown notice. YouTube pulled the video and Sterling posted a 9-minute [response] entitled “Another Copyright Takedown By Another Poopbrain Dev”.

Apparently feeling they hadn’t kicked up enough hornets, Digipex gave this statement to [Kotaku]:

> is about time somebody stop that stupid guy. I seen all his video he is enjoying making money from, is from steam greenlight. and greenlight videos are from poor indie guys or new companies who have little to defends them self. almost all of green light projects are still underdevelopment the developers are still working on it.

> I know he got the law on his side and little followers. some of the green light developers too have contact me that saying that does how he do use the law and He will get the video back running. but that does not mean He will continue to enjoy the HARD WORK of the Indie Game Developers videos forever.

According to [this article], Digipex has since taken their game out of Green Light.

This episode underscores the importance to game developers (large and small) of taking a thoughtful approach to brand protection. This kind of press certainly doesn't help—especially if you’re a small indie developer. Given the reports that they've withdrawn their Greenlight application and generally gone to ground, the [Streisand Effect] may have killed this project.

Most developers and publishers are wisely tolerant of fans' use of their IP, but the temptation to crack down when the message isn't a positive one can be strong, and should be carefully and objectively examined before taking action.

It’s not clear whether Sterling will file a counter notification, or if Digipex has the intent (or the resources) to sue Sterling. Although Sterling makes money from his YouTube channel, I’d say the case for fair use here is strong.

Sterling's video was not exactly in the vein of constructive criticism, but had the developers taken it that way (or simply ignored it) things might have turned out very differently.
