In a non-precedential opinion, the TTAB granted CAT's opposition to an application for the mark "BIG CAT" by the Big Cat Energy Corporation, finding a likelihood of confusion between Caterpillar's famous marks and Big Cat's not-so-famous marks.  Big Cat sells the [ARID Aquifer Recharge Injection System](http://www.bigcatenergy.com/ARID-Solution.aspx), a proprietary combination of technology and services designed to manage water produced by coal bed methane and coal seam natural gas wells. Caterpillar sells heavy equipment that is used in the preparation, drilling, operation, and extraction of such wells. 





The TTAB found that:







  * The CAT marks are famous (and thus entitled to broad protection), including in the oil and gas industry. 


  * There is a sufficient relationship between Big Cat's hydrogeological technology and Caterpillar's heavy machinery to cause consumer confusion, notwithstanding the likely sophistication of many consumers. The TTAB distinguished between the (sophisticated) owners and operators of gas wells and the (presumably less sophisticated) "array of contractors in the post-sale context."


  * The "highly descriptive" term "big" is insufficient to distinguish the parties' marks. The TTAB noted that Caterpillar's products are often referred to as "big CATS".


  * There is limited usage of similar marks in the oil and gas industry.


  * There was little evidence of actual confusion, but that was to be expected given that the market at issue is a "niche" market and that Big Cat operates in a limited geographic area.
