Between 1958 and 1963, Jack Kirby[^1] drew over 250 comics for Marvel Comics as a freelance artist. He was paid by the page, worked from home, set his own hours, received no benefits, and was not reimbursed for expenses or overhead. He also got more work from Marvel than he could handle, and produced most of his work during that time period for Marvel.

Typically, Stan Lee[^2] would give Kirby a plot synopsis, from which Kirby would draw the comic. Lee then would add the dialogue and captions. Kirby himself often came up with characters, influenced the plot, or pitched entirely new projects.[^3]

Fifty years later, Kirby's children served Marvel with a termination notice pursuant to § 304(c)(2) of the Copyright Act of 1976, seeking to terminate Marvel's rights with respect to 262 works created by Kirby during that five-year period.

Termination Rights
------------------

The term of copyright for works created prior to January 1, 1978 is 28 years.[^4] The copyright may be renewed for a second term of 67 years. If the author is deceased at the time of expiration of the initial term, the the renewed term vests in the author's widow, widower, or children; if they are not living (or nonexistent), the author's executors; in the absence of a will, the author's next of kin.[^5]

An author's pre-1978 grant of rights in or to a pre-1978 copyrighted work can be terminated posthumously by the author's widow/widower and/or children, who shall share the rights *per stirpes*.[^6] Termination may be effected during a five-year window beginning on the later of (1) 56 years from the date the copyright was originally secured; or (2) January 1, 1978.[^6]

Termination rights do not exist with respect to works made for hire.

Works Made for Hire
-------------------

Copyright vests, at least initially, in the author(s) of a work.[^7] In the case of a "work made for hire," the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author. Works prepared by employees in the course of their employment are works made for hire. Under certain circumstances, a work prepared by a person who is not an employee of the hiring party can be considered a work made for hire. For works created on or after January 1, 1978, the Copyright Act of 1976 identifies nine categories of works that can be works made for hire "if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire."[^8]

For pre-1978 works, courts in the Second Circuit have cobbled together the "instance and expense" test: a work is made "for hire"" when it is made at the hiring party's "instance and expense." In a nutshell, the more involved in the process the hiring party is—and especially the more control and supervision over the process the hiring party has and the more resources the hiring party invests in the work—the more likely the courts are to find a work was made "for hire." Like many judicially-created tests, the "instance and expense" test is vague, highly fact-specific, and rests on a foundation of often incongruous and occasionally inconsistent decisions.

Marvel v. Kirby
---------------

In 2010, in response to the Kirby children's notices of termination, Marvel filed an action for declaratory relief in the Southern District of New York, contending that all of Kirby's comics were works made for hire, and thus the Kirbys had no termination rights. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Marvel, and the Kirbys appealed. Last year, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's decision, finding that Kirby created the works in question at Marvel's instance and expense.[^10]

#### Instance

The court found that the evidence "establishe\[d\] beyond dispute that the works in question were made at Marvel's instance." The evidence supporting this conclusion included:

-   Kirby's relationship with Marvel was "close and continuous."

-   Most of Kirby's work during that period was for Marvel.

-   Kirby did not work on spec; his "ongoing partnership with Marvel, however unbalanced and under-remunerative to the artist, is … what induced Kirby's creation of the works."

-   Marvel had the power to require Kirby to redo or alter his pages.

-   Kirby collaborated with Lee on many of the works.

> That Marvel owes many of its triumphs to Kirby is beyond question. But the hired party's ingenuity and acumen are a substantial reason for the hiring party to have enlisted him. It makes little sense to foreclose a finding that work is made for hire because the hired artist indeed put his exceptional gifts to work for the party that contracted for their benefit.[^11]

#### Expense

The court found also that the works were created at Marvel's expense, though it acknowledged that this was a closer call. This factor generally focuses on who bears the risk of creating the works.

### In Favor of Work-for-Hire

-   Marvel paid Kirby a flat rate per page and no royalties.[^12]

-   Kirby's works were generally designed to fit within specific Marvel titles and themes (and thus could not be offered to other publishers).

-   Marvel made creative contributions and provided production work.

### Against Work-for-Hire

-   Kirby himself bore the costs of creating the works.

-   Marvel did not pay for Kirby's supplies or provide him with office space.[^13]

-   Marvel could reject Kirby's pages, or require him to redo them.[^14]

> In the final analysis, then, the record suggests that both parties took on risks with respect to the works' success — Kirby that he might occasionally not be paid for the labor and materials for certain pages, and Marvel that the pages it did pay for might not result in a successful comic book. But we think that Marvel's payment of a flat rate and its contribution of both creative and production value, in light of the parties' relationship as a whole, is enough to satisfy the expense requirement."[^15]

Closure
-------

The Kirbys petitioned the Supreme Court to grant certiorari. Several amicus briefs were filed in favor of certiorari by individuals and groups aligned with creative artists, arguing that the Second Circuit's problematic "instance and expense" test is inconsistent with the plain language and prevailing interpretations of the 1909 Copyright Act, and unfairly prejudices creators of works—and in particular, freelance artists. The Court was to have decided whether to grant certiorari on Monday. However, last Friday the parties announced they had reached a settlement.

A Supreme Court decision in *Marvel* could have brought much-needed clarity to pre-1978 "work-for-hire" jurisprudence and had broad-reaching effects for the entertainment industry as a whole. Instead, the Second Circuit's decision stands as binding precedent in that circuit and we can all look forward to *Spider Man & Ant-Man vs. Wolverine & Hulk 3: Iron Man in Asgard* in 2021.[^16]

[^1]: Known as the "King of Comics," Kirby is credited with bringing Marvel Comics back from the brink of failure and ushering in the "Marvel Age of Comics." 

[^2]: Lee, who replaced Kirby when Kirby left Marvel for DC in the '40s, is best known for his portrayal of "man reading a newspaper who almost gets hit by a bus" in the 2003 film, *Daredevil*. 

[^3]: Kirby created or co-created such enduring characters as Captain America, The Fantastic Four, The Mighty Thor, The Incredible Hulk, The Avengers, X-Men, Spider-Man, and Ant-Man. Characters that have generated billions of dollars for Marvel and Disney over the last decade. 

[^4]: 17 U.S.C. §304(a)(1). 

[^5]: 17 U.S.C. § 304(a)(1)(C). 

[^6]: 17 U.S.C. § 304(c)(2). An example of *per stirpes* distribution: If the author is survived by a widow and two children, the widow gets 50% and the children each get 25%. 

[^7]: Makes sense, right? Copyright law is so intuitive. 

[^8]: 17 U.S.C. § 201. 

[^9]: "\[A\] work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas…." 

[^10]: *Marvel Characters, Inc. v. Kirby*, 726 F.3d 119 (2d Cir. 2013). 

[^11]: 726 F.4d at 142. 

[^12]: The Second Circuit has held that payment of a "sum certain" suggests a work-for-hire arrangement whereas royalties tilt the scales in the opposite direction. *See, e.g., Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Dumas*, 53 F.3d 549 (2d Cir. 1995). 

[^13]: The Second Circuit seems to have been somewhat conflicted as to whether or not this is a relevant factor (*Compare Martha Graham School and Dance Foundation, Inc. v. Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, Inc.,* 380 F.3d 624 (2d Cir. 2004), *with Playboy Enterprises, Inc., supra.*), and the *Marvel* decision does not conclusively settle the issue. 

[^14]: This arguably placed the risk of creating the works squarely on Kirby's shoulders, but the court found that Kirby created the works with "the expectation, established through their ongoing, mutually beneficial relationship, that Marvel would pay him." 

[^15]: 726 F.3d at 143. 

[^16]: I would totally watch that.
