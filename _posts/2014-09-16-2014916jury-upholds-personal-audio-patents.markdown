On Monday, the jury in Personal Audio's ["podcast patent" lawsuit](/nerdlawyer?tag=podcasting) came back with a $1.3 million award in Personal Audio's favor against CBS. This is much less than Personal Audio reportedly asked for (around 8 million), and probably close to (if not below) break-even for Personal Audio. Nevertheless, this can only encourage Personal Audio to go after others (_e.g._ the other TV networks). Although the jury declined to invalidate any of Personal Audio's patents, the EFF's [validity challenge](https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-personal-audio-llc) remains pending at the PTO.

Adam Carolla and his [putative partners](http://mbsmithlaw.com/nerdlawyer/2014/9/10/carolla-settles-podcast-suit) [settled](http://mbsmithlaw.com/nerdlawyer/2014/8/23/carolla-settles-patent-troll-lawsuit) with Personal Audio last month.
