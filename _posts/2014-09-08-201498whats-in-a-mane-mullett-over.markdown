Every Picture Tells a Story, and this one:

![The Schiffman photograph](http://69.89.27.245/~mbsmithl/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img3.png)

might have prompted some foolish behaviour.

The mullet in question, which may have you thinking, "blondes have more fun," belongs to none other than the seemingly forever young Rod Stewart (and he wears it well). Bonnie Schiffman, the photographer who took the photo (I guess old Rod wasn't a smiler), has filed a complaint alleging that Stewart and his people are out of order and played foot loose and fancy free with her copyright.

According to the complaint, Stewart's people contacted her in 2010, saying "We'll pay you \$1,500, my girl," to license the image for a billboard advertising Stewart's comeback tour.[^1] That paltry sum threw a spanner in the works and, unable to camouflage the passion and disappointment in her vagabond, rebel heart, Schiffman did not say "tonight I'm yours." She asked for more money, but Stewart's people said, "I don't want to talk about it." It takes two to make a deal, but they were so far away from each other that it ended in just another heartache.

Cut to 2013 (the first cut is the deepest). Stewart is performing in Las Vegas, that dirty old town (not my town) where there's never a dull moment. Schiffman alleges that, as people got ready for a night on the town, twistin' the night away in Sin City, with their handbags and gladrags, thinking, "Tonight's the night—it's gonna be all right," they were being regaled with this image:

![The allegedly infringing image](http://69.89.27.245/~mbsmithl/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/img2.png)

Upon seeing this, some probably said "Oh, god, I wish I was home tonight," but Schiffman said, "Oh no! Not my baby[^2]!" Schiffman says that Stewart is a great pretender who has misappropriated ("Mine for me," he might have said) the most recognizable elements of her "famous and distinctive picture," which graced the cover of Stewart's 1989 album, *Storyteller*.

When Schiffman's cease-and-desist letter didn't do the trick, she ran to the courthouse faster than a racecar coming out of Gasoline Alley, or the Concord sailing along its Atlantic crossing, and filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging willful copyright infringement. Schiffman is seeking to get back her rights through injunctive relief, compensatory, punitive, and/or statutory damages, costs and attorney's fees, and such other and further relief as that august body wishes to grant.

Stewart's probably not crazy about her, but what will Stewart say in his defense?[^3] He may be a street fighting man, and he's certainly no angel, but Stewart is only human, and I have reason to believe he'll soon be able to say "It's all over now, for this old heart of mine." (Even if he has to tell Schiffman, as if in a broken dream, "you made a loser out of me.") Some guys have all the luck. Still, perhaps he should have gone with a picture of himself in an old raincoat. An old raincoat won't ever let you down.
