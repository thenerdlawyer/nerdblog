TVEyes is a media-monitoring service that records the entire content of TV and radio broadcasts and (using closed captions and speech-to-text technology) creates a searchable database of that content. Subscribers can search for particular terms, access various metrics, set up email alerts, read transcripts, edit and/or download video clips,[^1] and watch a live stream of anything TVEyes is recording. Subscribers also can share clips, or links to clips, with non-subscribers.[^2] In fact, TVEyes advertises that its users can "email unlimited clips to unlimited recipients" and "post an unlimited number of clips" to social media.[^3]

Fox News does not like this very much. In fact, Fox News likes it so little that it sued TVEyes for copyright infringement[^4] and asked the court to enjoin TVEyes. What Fox News probably likes even less is the Southern District of New York's recent decision denying that request and granting TVEyes partial summary judgment on the grounds that TVEyes' services constitute fair use.[^5] The court's analysis of the statutory fair use factors is summarized below.

Purpose & Character of Use
--------------------------

Distinguishing TVEyes' service from that of a traditional news clipping service,[^6] the court found that TVEyes' search engine, together with its display of result clips, is transformative in that it allows consumers to search, organize, and analyze not only the news, but the way in which the news is presented:

<blockquote>
> By indexing and excerpting all content appearing in television, every hour of the day and every day of the week, month, and year, TVEyes provides a service that no content provider provides. Subscribers to TVEyes gain access, not only to the news that is presented, but to the presentations themselves, as colored, processed, and criticized by commentators, and as abridged, modified, and enlarged by news broadcasts.

</blockquote>
Nature of Work
--------------

The court found the second factor to be neutral, since (a) the works at issue are "largely informational" and (b) the use is transformative. Although the court's decision focuses exclusively on TVEyes' copying of news-related media, it is not entirely clear whether TVEyes' service actually is limited to such media. According to the court's decision, "TVEyes is the only service that creates a database of *everything* that television channels broadcast, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week." According to TVEyes' [website], TVEyes' coverage includes "all major network affiliates and national cable stations." One imagines copying of content other than news media is something the court would have mentioned. Nevertheless, to the extent that TVEyes' service does extend beyond news shows, such copying would not necessarily be found to be fair use.

Amount & Substantiality of Portion Used
---------------------------------------

The court focused heavily on the fact that TVEyes copies *everything* Fox News broadcasts, 24/7. In a somewhat unusual turn, the court found this fact to be generally supportive of a finding of fair use. The court found that TVEyes' service is transformative because it makes available, online, copyrighted content that Fox News has chosen *not* to provide online.[^7] The court further found that , because the value of TVEyes' database "depends on its all-inclusive nature," TVEyes copies only what is necessary to its transformative purpose.

Market Impact
-------------

Fox News was unable to demonstrate economic injury based on alleged loss of cable/satellite subscribers. In the 32 days the 19 hour-long Fox News programs at issue in the lawsuit were available on TVEyes,[^8] only 560 clips were played, with an average length of 53.4 seconds.[^9] More than half of the clips were played for less than 10 seconds.[^10] The court found that these statistics were in line with broader usage statistics.

Based in part on these numbers, the court dismissed as "unrealistic" Fox's argument that a TVEyes subscriber could watch entire programs within minutes after they air by watching sequential ten-minute clips end to end, and found that "\[n\]o reasonable juror could find that people are using TVEyes as a substitute for watching Fox News broadcasts on television." Likewise, the court found that Fox News had not shown any impact on the derivative market for online video clips, and that in any event Fox's revenue from licensing of clips represented "a very small fraction of its overall revenue."

The court also found that TVEyes' service (excepting the social media sharing capability) provides a significant public benefit, as it is used by commenters, critics, government bodies, political campaigns, financial firms, the White House, the US Army, journalists, and elected officials for various purposes of substantial benefit to the public.

Some Uses Still in Play
-----------------------

The court found that the record was not sufficiently developed to determine whether certain aspects of the TVEyes service—specifically, the ability to search by date and time, archive clips, download clips, email clips, or share clips via social media—are "integral services" protected by fair use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[^1]: Clips can be up to 10 minutes in length; most are less than 2. 

[^2]: *E.g.*, via email or social media 

[^3]: Somewhat incongruously, TVEyes requires subscribers to sign an agreement limiting the use of downloaded clips to internal purposes. 

[^4]: Fox News also asserted causes of action for "hot news" misappropriation and plain old "misappropriation." The court found both state law claims were pre-empted by the Copyright Act. 

[^5]: SDNY Case No. 1:13-cv-05315-AKH 

[^6]: "A service that provides clipping of news articles and columns provides essentially the same service as could be provided by the content provider itself." 

[^7]: "The Internet does not and cannot house the entirety of this content because Fox News … does not provide all of its content online. Thus, without TVEyes, this information cannot otherwise be gathered and searched. That, in and of itself, makes TVEyes' purpose transformative…." 

[^8]: TVEyes erases content after 32 days. 

[^9]: Full range: 11.5 seconds to 6 minutes. 

[^10]: 85.5% were played for less than one minute, 76% for less than 30 seconds, and 51% for less than 10 seconds.
